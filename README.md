**C. Essay questions:**

I. Among all categorizations of Artificial Intelligence, which kind of categorization do you think is most useful for understanding Artificial Intelligence (not limited in lecture provided categorization)? Brief explain of reason for selection is required. (14%)

 *Your answer:*
the answer : the most useful categorization for understanding AI is base on functionality. because by knowing the functionality, we can implement AI appropriately and correctly


II. In each rise and fall of Artificial Intelligence, what role did Domain Knowledge or Expert’s Knowledge play? Is Domain or Expert’s knowledge important for Artificial Intelligence? (16%)

 *Your answer:*
the answer : In my opinion, domain knowledge and expert knowledge are very important in AI because domain knowledge plays a very important role in the programming process and expert knowledge plays a role in The problem-solving process being described and then analyzed to produce a structured model.
